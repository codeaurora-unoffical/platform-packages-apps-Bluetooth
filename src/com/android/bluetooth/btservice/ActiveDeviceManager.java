/**
 * The active device manager is responsible for keeping track of the
 * connected A2DP/HFP/AVRCP devices and select which device is
 * active (for each profile).
 *
 * Current policy (subject to change):
 * 1) If the maximum number of connected devices is one, the manager doesn't
 *    do anything. Each profile is responsible for automatically selecting
 *    the connected device as active. Only if the maximum number of connected
 *    devices is more than one, the rules below will apply.
 * 2) The selected A2DP active device is the one used for AVRCP as well.
 * 3) The HFP active device might be different from the A2DP active device.
 * 4) The Active Device Manager always listens for
 *    ACTION_ACTIVE_DEVICE_CHANGED broadcasts for each profile:
 *    - BluetoothA2dp.ACTION_ACTIVE_DEVICE_CHANGED for A2DP
 *    - BluetoothHeadset.ACTION_ACTIVE_DEVICE_CHANGED for HFP
 *    If such broadcast is received (e.g., triggered indirectly by user
 *    action on the UI), the device in the received broacast is marked
 *    as the current active device for that profile.
 * 5) If there are no connected devices (e.g., during startup, or after all
 *    devices have been disconnected, the active device per profile
 *    (either A2DP or HFP) is selected as follows:
 * 5.1) The first connected device (for either A2DP or HFP) is immediately
 *      selected as active for that profile. Assume the first connected device
 *      is for A2DP.
 * 5.2) A timer is started: if the same device is connected for the other
 *      profile as well (HFP in this example) while the timer is running,
 *      and there is no active HFP device yet, that device is selected as
 *      active for HFP as well. The purpose is to select by default the same
 *      device as active for both profiles.
 * 5.3) While the timer is running, all other HFP connected devices are
 *      listed locally, but none of those devices is selected as active.
 * 5.4) While the timer is running, if ACTION_ACTIVE_DEVICE_CHANGED broadcast
 *      is received for HFP, the device contained in the broadcast is
 *      marked as active.
 * 5.5) If the timer expires and no HFP device has been selected as active,
 *      the first HFP connected device is selected as active.
 * 6) If the currently active device (per profile) is disconnected, the
 *    Active Device Manager just marks that the profile has no active device,
 *    but does not attempt to select a new one. Currently, the expectation is
 *    that the user will explicitly select the new active device.
 * 7) If there is already an active device, and the corresponding
 *    ACTION_ACTIVE_DEVICE_CHANGED broadcast is received, the device
 *    contained in the broadcast is marked as active. However, if
 *    the contained device is null, the corresponding profile is marked
 *    as having no active device.
